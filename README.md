Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.*### Website Requirements - The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:	- name of the site on the left of the nav.	- dropdown menu on the right of the navbar named "Plots" that provides a link to each 	  individual visualization page.	- "Comparisons," which links to the comparisons page, and "Data," which links to the data page.	- 'Home' link to return to the landing page from any page.- The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:	- __A landing page__ containing:		- An explanation of the project.		- Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.	- __Four visualization pages__, each with:		- A descriptive title and heading tag.		- The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.		- A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.	- __A "Comparisons" page__ that:		- Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually 		  compare them.		- Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.	- __A "Data" page__ that:		- Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.		- The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint		- The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, ## Screen Shots- __1.
